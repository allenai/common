# AllenAI Testkit

The `testkit` is a library that provides base classes and helpers to facilitate testing.

## Installation

To use, you will need to declare a test-scoped dependency on the `testkit`:

```scala
// in build.sbt:
libraryDependencies += "org.allenai.common" %% "testkit" % "0.0.1-SNAPSHOT" % "test"
```

## Usage

There are specs for the base classes which should be enough to get you started.
Look in `testkit/src/test/scala/org/allenai/common/testkit` for examples.
